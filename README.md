# 3DCloudMesh

## Description
This repository contains the research and implementation of `3DCloudMesh`, a comprehensive framework for point cloud processing in mixed reality systems. The focus is on semantic understanding, mesh generation, and completion. The research delves into mesh reconstruction and replacement, which are crucial for mixed reality embedding.

## Abstract
The research presents a comprehensive exploration of point cloud processing, with a particular emphasis on its application in mixed reality systems. It introduces a novel framework for point cloud completion that leverages attention mechanisms to capture the structural information of 3D shapes. This approach eliminates the need for explicit local region operations, mitigating the influence of data density distribution and achieving high-quality complete shapes with precise geometrical details.

## Key Features
- Semantic Understanding: Assigns meaningful labels to each segmented region, providing a deeper understanding of the 3D scene captured.
- Mesh Generation and Replacement: Involves the creation of a meshâ€”a three-dimensional representation of a scene or object comprised of connected triangles.
- Point Cloud Completion: Leverages attention mechanisms to capture the structural information of 3D shapes, achieving high-quality complete shapes with precise geometrical details.
